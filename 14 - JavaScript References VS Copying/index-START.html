    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team1 = players

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team1[3] = "Lux"
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(players, team1)
    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // "team" is just a reference to the original array "players"

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice()

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players)

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]
    team4[3] = "Bob"
    console.log(players, team4)

    const team5 = Array.from(players)
    console.log(team5)

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object


    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captain = person
    // captain.number = 99
    // console.log(person)

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    // Let's create a new object "captain" which is a copy of "person" but with age = 99 and number = 12:
    const captain1 = Object.assign({}, person, { age: 99, number: 12 })

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const captain2 = {...person} 

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const wes = {
      name: "Wes",
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: "@wesbos",
        facebook: "wesbos.developer"
      }
    }

    console.log(wes)

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes)
    dev.age = 99
    dev.social.twitter = "@newUser"
    
    // By stringifying and the parsing, we get a full level copy of it. (Not ideal for performance)
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes))

    dev2.social.twitter = "@userTwo"
